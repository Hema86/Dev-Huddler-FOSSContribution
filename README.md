# Dev-Huddler-FOSS Contribution Demo

Demo on FOSS contribution. 

For this project, our task is to collectively mark up a letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a response from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student concerning their application to work at the university.

Each one of us will pick an issue, make appropriate changes locally and initiate a pull request.
The aim is to give an hands-on demo on how any open-source contribution can be made to any open-source project. 

P.S - Open source software !== Free Software.
